# Project Title

This is for the fetch interview process, I wrote this in python as it's a very simple language and cross-platform compatible for the most part. Written in 3 hours with ChatGPT. Threw this into docker for cross-platform compatibility.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requests,pyyaml
    ```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
```sh
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your script.

## Architecture

The goal of this program is have everything written out in the main() module, then there will be API interfaces between each function so you can delve into each error as it crops up. So far this hasn't affected execution speeds(test set was 100 sites).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, I don't know why you would but be my guest! Just submit a PR, if I see it I'll do something with it(this whole repo will probably be deleted once the job interview is done[if I remember])
